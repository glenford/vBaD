vBaD - Visualising Builds and Deploys
=====================================

vBad aims to provide a simple to setup and use platform
to help you visualise your builds and deploys by providing
a style of mashup dashboard.


!! IMPORTANT !!

This repository is still in flux, and is far from stable,
use this at your own risk.


History
-------

vBaD is based upon some cobbled together scripts and web
pages that I used some time ago.  Unfortunately those scripts
and pages were lost.  vBaD is an attempt to take those ideas
to the next level, at the moment development is prototypical,
testing is light, structure is non-ideal, but hopefully that
will evolve as time goes on.


Current Features
----------------

Currently vBaD provides:

+ basic dashboard with a rotating iframe with some information
  areas
  - iframe times how long it takes to load and reports that in
    a status pane


Usage
-----

The quickest way to make use of vBaD at present is to clone
the github repository and then use sbt to run it.

sbt can be found here:

http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/

You will need to first build James Strachan's webbytest

bash$ git clone http://github.com/jstrachan/webbytest.git
bash$ cd webbytest

! Note webbytest has an issue (5) that needs resolving to work
  for vBaD, namely change HtmlTestsProject to extend BasicScalaProject
  rather than DefaultProject:
  src/main/scala/webbytest/HtmlTestsProject.scala

bash$ sbt update publish-local

then do the following:

bash$ cd ..
bash$ git clone git://github.com/glenford/vBaD.git
bash$ cd vBaD
bash$ sbt update jetty-run

It will download all its dependencies and build vBaD, then you
will then have vBaD running on localhost at port 8080.

Point your browser at http://localhost:8080

If you wish to deploy to a web container - at this point only
Jetty is actively supported - the you can create a war by using
the sbt package command.

bash$ sbt update package

If you wish to work on the codebase and use IntelliJ, ensure you
have the scala plugin, and use the following to generate a project
file

bash$ sbt idea
