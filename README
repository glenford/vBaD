vBaD - Visualising Builds and Deploys
=====================================

vBad aims to provide a simple to setup and use platform
to help you visualise your builds and deploys by providing
a style of mashup dashboard.


!! IMPORTANT !!

This repository is still in flux, and is far from stable,
use this at your own risk.


History
-------

vBaD is based upon some cobbled together scripts and web
pages that I used some time ago.  Unfortunately those scripts
and pages were lost.  vBaD is an attempt to take those ideas
to the next level, at the moment development is prototypical,
testing is light, structure is non-ideal, but hopefully that
will evolve as time goes on.


Usage
-----

The quickest way to make use of vBaD at present is to clone
the github repository and then use sbt to run it.

sbt can be found here:

http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/

then do the following:

bash$ git clone git://github.com/glenford/vBaD.git
bash$ cd vBaD
bash$ sbt
[info] Building project vBaD 0.1 against Scala 2.8.0
[info]    using vBaDProject with sbt 0.7.4 and Scala 2.8.0
> jetty-run

I will download all its dependencies and build vBaD, then you
will then have vBaD running on localhost at port 8080

Point your browser at http://localhost:8080
