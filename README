vBaD - Visualising Builds and Deploys
=====================================

vBad aims to provide a simple to setup and use platform
to help you visualise your builds and deploys by providing
a style of mashup dashboard.

History
-------

vBaD is based upon some cobbled together scripts and web
pages that I put together some time ago.  Its an attempt
to take those to the next level.
